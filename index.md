## What is it?
**basicbots** is a programming game where you write a program in *BASIC* and have it compete against other robots.

## Play Testers
- Even if you don't know *BASIC* it's easy to learn. There are resources on the internet about programming in *BASIC*, look for the really old ones. I and as time goes on, others will be more than happy to help out.
