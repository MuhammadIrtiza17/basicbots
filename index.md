## Play Testers
- Even if you don't know *BASIC* it's easy to learn. There are resources on the internet about programming in *BASIC*, look for the really old ones. I and as time goes on, others will be more than happy to help out.

## Who am I?
I am an old-school type of guy. I enjoy games from a time when graphics wasn't the main focus of a game and when you died, you had to start over.
