## TO DO

## Coding conventions
- Start reading our code and you'll get the hang of it. We optimize for readability.
- This is open-source software. Consider the people who will read your code, and make it look nice for them. It's sort of like driving a car: Perhaps you love doing donuts when you're alone, but with passengers, the goal is to make the ride as smooth as possible.
- use gofmt & vet on all source files before pushing. There _should not_ be any errors or warnings.
- use an editor that will automatically perform the gofmt and lint for you. I suggest [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) with the go extensions.
